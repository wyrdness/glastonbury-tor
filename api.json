      "summary": "A prominent hill topped by the roofless St. Michael's Tower in Somerset, England, associated with Arthurian legend, Celtic mythology, ley line theories, and Christian pilgrimage. One of Britain's most spiritually significant landscapes.",
      "full": "Glastonbury Tor is a 158-meter (518-foot) hill that dominates the Somerset Levels landscape in southwest England. Topped by the ruins of St. Michael's Tower, the Tor has been a focal point of legend, mythology, and spiritual significance for millennia. The site is associated with the legendary Isle of Avalon, King Arthur's final resting place, and Celtic traditions identifying it as an entrance to Annwn, the Otherworld. The hill features distinctive terracing that some interpret as a ritual labyrinth. Nearby Glastonbury Abbey adds Christian significance, claiming connections to Joseph of Arimathea and the Holy Grail. Modern theories position the Tor as a major ley line junction. Archaeological evidence reveals occupation from Neolithic times through medieval periods. Today, it remains a pilgrimage site for Christians, pagans, New Age practitioners, and tourists, representing a unique convergence of ancient, medieval, and modern spiritual traditions."
