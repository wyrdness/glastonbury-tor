      "full": "Glastonbury Tor is a 158-meter (518-foot) hill that dominates the Somerset Levels landscape in southwest England. Topped by the ruins of the 14th-century St. Michael's Tower, the Tor has been a focal point of legend, mythology, and spiritual significance for millennia. The site is inextricably linked with the legendary Isle of Avalon, identified by medieval tradition as King Arthur's final resting place. Celtic traditions recognize it as an entrance to Annwn, the Otherworld. The hill features distinctive seven-tier terracing that some interpret as an ancient ritual labyrinth, though this remains disputed. Nearby Glastonbury Abbey enhances the site's Christian significance, with traditions linking it to Joseph of Arimathea and the Holy Grail. Modern esoteric theories position the Tor as a major ley line junction and energy vortex. Archaeological evidence reveals human activity from Neolithic times through medieval periods, confirming its long-standing significance. Today, it remains a pilgrimage site for Christians, pagans, New Age practitioners, and tourists, representing a unique convergence of ancient, medieval, and modern spiritual traditions. With over 250,000 visitors annually, Glastonbury Tor stands as one of Britain's most iconic and spiritually significant landscapes."
